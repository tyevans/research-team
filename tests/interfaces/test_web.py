# `test_index_is_served` moved to `test_web_console.py`, beside the unbuilt
# case. It mounted the real `STATIC_DIR`, which no longer exists in a clone
# that has not run `npm run build` -- so it asserted 200 and got the 503 that
# absence is now supposed to produce, in a CI job with no Node toolchain to
# fix it with. Its replacement builds a one-line `index.html` and tests the
# route, which is what it was ever about.
