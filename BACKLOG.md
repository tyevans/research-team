# Backlog

Deferred work. Every deficiency found and not fixed on the spot lands here,
with enough detail that picking it up does not require rediscovering it.

The `B` numbers are stable handles, not a taxonomy. Closed entries are deleted;
if tracked code cites one by name, say where its reasoning went before deleting.

## Code quality

### B1. `Project`'s class docstring says little that its module does not

`research_team/domain/project.py`. The class docstring is near-verbatim from
`CodingSession`'s — "the imperative shell, holds no rules, delegates all
three" — and the `Project`-specific reasoning it might add is already in the
module docstring above it. Not wrong, just thin: a reader who came for the
difference between the two aggregates does not find it here.

Found in the Task 1 review of the projects/redstring work and deferred as
Minor, because the docstring convention is satisfied and nothing is
misleading.

### B3. No type checking

`mypy` is not configured and has never run against this codebase. The CI gate
added alongside the projects/redstring work covers `ruff check`, `ruff format`
and the test suites, and deliberately stops there.

Deferred on measurement rather than principle: ~40 modules have never been
type-checked, so `mypy --strict` is an open-ended migration whose size is
unknown until it is run, and starting one in the middle of a feature was the
wrong trade. The sibling project (`redstring`) gates on `mypy --strict` and is
the model to copy when this is picked up.

Do not add mypy in permissive mode as a stepping stone. A gate that starts
permissive tends to stay permissive, and it costs the honesty of saying
plainly, as this entry does, that there is no type checking today.

### B4. Two tests flake under machine load

Both surfaced during the projects/redstring work, each failing once and passing
on an isolated re-run, on a machine running several other projects' containers:

- `tests/interfaces/test_web.py::test_stream_reaches_a_real_browser_over_a_real_socket`
  — waits up to 10s on a real socket for an SSE frame.
- A cancel-settle test in `tests/application/test_turn_supervisor.py` with
  `settle_timeout=0.1`.

Both are wall-clock races against a loaded scheduler, not logic faults, and
both are testing something worth testing — a real socket and a real timeout
are the point. The fix is not a longer sleep: it is making the wait
condition-driven, or making the timeout injectable so the test names its own.

Left alone for now because they pass reliably on an unloaded machine and the
CI runner is quieter than the machine they flaked on. If CI proves otherwise,
this moves up.

### B5. An unclosed `SQLiteEventStore` blocks interpreter shutdown

**This entry was wrong when first filed and has been corrected.** It originally
blamed `SQLiteSnapshotStore` for lacking a `close()`. That store is innocent: it
opens a connection per operation via `async with aiosqlite.connect(...)` and
leaves no threads behind, so having no `close()` is right for it. The original
diagnosis was a hypothesis that fit the symptom and was never tested against the
alternative.

What actually happens, measured:

- `SQLiteEventStore` holds one long-lived aiosqlite connection, and aiosqlite's
  connection worker thread is **non-daemon**.
- Call `close()` and the thread goes; the process exits clean.
- Forget `close()` and the thread outlives the loop. The process then parks in
  `threading._shutdown` waiting for a thread that will never finish, and on the
  way out aiosqlite raises `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` from
  `call_soon_threadsafe` — neither of which names the store that was not closed.

Where it bites here: most tests construct a `SQLiteEventStore` and never close
it. Usually harmless; once, it turned a passing test into an apparent infinite
hang, and only a `faulthandler` dump distinguished "hung" from "finished, then
could not exit". See the upstream notes for the changes that would make this
self-diagnosing rather than a day's detective work.

**It also flakes the suite, which is how it will actually reach you.** In
`tests/infrastructure/test_knowledge_rebuild.py`, two tests build an adapter and
never close the event store, so their worker threads are still live when a later
test in the same file runs — and under full-suite load that test intermittently
fails. It was first reported as "the same class as B4"; it is not. B4 is a socket
test and a timing test racing the scheduler. This is threads outliving their test
and contending, which is a different and more tractable problem: close the stores.

*(Original title, for anyone following a link: "`SQLiteSnapshotStore` cannot be
closed, and its thread outlives the process".)*

### B6. `undo_merge` always reports `reason=None`

`RedstringKnowledge.undo_merge` builds its `MergeRecord` from
`ConsolidationReport.reason`, and `Consolidator.undo` documents that field as
`None` for an undo — the reason belongs to the merge, not to its reversal. So
the `reason` on an undo's record is always empty, and a caller reading it sees
nothing rather than the reason the original merge was made.

Nothing is wrong today: `unmerge`'s tool output does not print it. It becomes a
papercut the moment something wants to say "this merge, made because X, was
reversed". The fix is either to say so in the docstring and leave it, or to read
the original `EntitiesMerged` off the consolidation stream and carry its reason
through. Deferred rather than guessed at, because which one is right depends on
whether any caller ever wants that string.

### B7. One weak assertion in the knowledge-tools tests

`tests/infrastructure/test_knowledge_tools.py::test_remember_reports_counts_and_confidence`
asserts `"7" in result and "4" in result` — bare digits, which could appear
incidentally inside a UUID or another number in the same output. It should
assert the whole informative phrase instead.

It came from the plan's own test code, and the surrounding assertions (the
domain name, the confidence disambiguation) make a false pass unlikely in
practice — which is why it was not worth a fix round on its own. Worth
correcting the next time that file is touched.

### B8. One accessor reaches through a private attribute

`Application.turns_tools()` in `research_team/composition.py` reads
`self.service._executor`, so a test can inspect which tools are bound.

**This entry has shrunk twice, and both reductions were the rule working.** It
originally covered two reaches. The REPL's `_project_repository` is gone —
`SessionService` grew `projects` and `list_projects`, so the interface asks
rather than reaches. And the `._tools` half is gone — the executor now has a
public `tools` property, added when Task 14 needed to swap tools at runtime
anyway. What survives is the `._executor` hop itself.

The remaining fix is a `tools` accessor on `SessionService`, or accepting that a
composition root may know its own executor. Left as-is because the case for the
latter is real and nobody has needed to decide.

**The rule that produced those reductions still stands: if a third reach
appears, fix the pattern rather than adding to it** — at that point it is the
codebase's convention whether anyone chose it or not.

### B10. `Application.close()` can skip `detach_project`

`research_team/composition.py`. `detach_project()` is the last statement after
`turns.cancel_all()`, `summaries.stop()` and `service.close()`. If any of those
raises, a Neo4j driver is left open at process exit.

Shutdown-path only, and only for the Neo4j backend, so nothing leaks in the
default in-memory configuration. The fix is a `finally` or a small ordered
teardown that runs every step regardless — worth doing the next time that
function is touched, not on its own.

### B11. The web UI's "last join wins" swaps tools under an open tab

`research_team/interfaces/web/app.py`, the join route. The web app serves every
session from one process with one executor, so a second browser tab joining
project B rebinds the executor's tools while tab A's session prompt still
describes project A's graph.

Chosen deliberately: this is a local single-user tool, and a per-session
attachment map would add isolation nothing currently needs. The route's
docstring says so. There is no corruption risk in flight — `set_tools` rebinds
rather than mutates, and a running turn keeps the list it started with.

It becomes worth fixing the moment two people, or two projects, use one server
at once. The shape is a per-session attachment keyed the way `TurnActivity`
already keys its buffers.

### B9. A silent no-op release hides one failure it cannot distinguish

`SessionService.release_project` returns early when the caller is not the
project's active holder. That is deliberate: releasing something you do not hold
should be nothing rather than an error, and it is what keeps the REPL's `finally`
from raising and skipping `service.close()`.

The cost is that two situations look identical — a session that correctly is not
the holder, and a session that *should* be the holder but lost `active_session_id`
through some logic error. Both no-op silently. A real bug of the second kind would
surface only as a later "held by nobody in particular", not as a loud failure.

Accepted as the better trade for now: the alternative reopens a `finally` that can
raise. If it needs closing, the cheap version is a logged warning when a session
carrying a `project_id` releases and finds itself not the holder — enough to leave
a trace without turning a shutdown path into a failure path.

## Waiting on redstring

### B2. Two workarounds to unwind when redstring closes R3 and R4

`research_team/infrastructure/knowledge/rebuild.py` carries two workarounds,
both commented in place, both recorded as R3 and R4 in
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-04-projects-and-redstring-knowledge-design.md`:

- **R3** — `redstring.projections.project` folds the *global* feed with no
  stream or category argument, so rebuilding one project's graph reads every
  session event in the store too. Scoping is by `tenant_filter` on the
  projection instead. Correct, but the scan is O(whole log) per project open,
  and that is the first thing to hurt as a store grows.
- **R4** — `ReplayReport.failed` is a count rather than a raise, so a poison
  event is swallowed and the graph comes up quietly incomplete. Project open
  checks the count by hand and refuses. A strict mode upstream would replace
  that check.

Both still stand as of redstring **0.2.0**, and both are worth filing upstream
with the detail found while upgrading:

- **R3 is a small change, not a redesign.** `GlobalEventFeed.read_all` already
  takes `FeedReadOptions(tenant_id=...)`, and eventsource's SQLite adapter
  pushes it into the `WHERE` clause. `project()` just never passes it.
  Forwarding a `tenant_id` would turn our per-open full-log scan into an
  indexed read.
- **R4's real defect is lost information, not the missing raise.** The handler
  is a bare `except Exception` that discards the exception, so `failed` is an
  integer with no way back to the offending event. We can implement the raise
  ourselves — we do — but we cannot reconstruct what redstring threw away. Ask
  for `ReplayReport.failures` carrying position, event type and error; the
  strict mode is the lesser half.

Of the other three gaps recorded in the same spec section, **R1 (embedding
provider) and R5 (understated eventsource floor) are closed in 0.2.0**. R2
(identifying unconsolidated entities) is still open, and is why the repair path
is keyed by `source_id` here rather than asking the library what is
unconsolidated.

R1 closing means vector search is now *possible*, not present: there is still
no `AGENT_VECTOR_STORE` and no recall path. That is a feature to spec, not a
workaround to delete, and it does not belong in this section.
